# Data Science Interview Prep

This repository contains my ongoing preparation materials for **Data Science**, **Analytics**, and **Machine Learning** interviews.  
It combines theory notes, coding practice, and mini case studies.

## Contents
- `python/` – Core syntax, data manipulation, and coding exercises.
- `sql/` – Query practice, window functions, and analytical examples.
- `statistics/` – Key distributions, tests, and regression intuition.
- `machine_learning/` – Common algorithms and model evaluation concepts.
- `business_cases/` – Problem-solving examples and applied case studies.
- `cheatsheets/` – Compact references for quick review.

## Goal
To consolidate and practice the **core concepts and coding skills** needed for:
- Data Science Graduate Schemes (Sky, BNP Paribas, Deloitte, etc.)
- Technical interviews (Python, SQL, ML, stats)
- Analytical reasoning and case questions.

## Status
This repo is **a work in progress** — updated as I learn and prepare.
