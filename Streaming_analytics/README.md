## Overview

This project builds a **modular analytics and machine learning pipeline** to explore and predict **user churn** for a fictional streaming platform.  
Using user demographics, subscription types, viewing behaviour, and login activity, the project demonstrates how to:

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Engineer **new features** such as *Days Since Last Login*
- Define a **churn metric** based on user activity
- Train and evaluate a **classification model**
- Visualise key insights about engagement and retention
